# Practicing React Hooks with the Tailwind UI Take-Home Test

Repo for my attempt at building the [Tailwind CSS take home test](https://github.com/adamwathan/tailwind-take-home-project).

Live URl [here](https://tailwind-take-home-test-react.vercel.app/). I basically used the test as a little project to experiment with Tailwind and also practice React Hooks and all of the content for the product was hard coded. I wrote a little [article](https://medium.com/@peter_aiello/practicing-react-hooks-using-the-tailwindcss-ui-take-home-test-89ce27ef34c9) on my experience using React.
